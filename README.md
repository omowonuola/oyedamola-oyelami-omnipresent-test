#The country code in the employee data was changed (especially for USA) from US to USA. This was done to aid the merging of the employee data array and the country data array. We needed a unique info in both arrays, hence resolved to using the employee country code and the cioc in the country api array.

#The final employee data has the basic employee data(firstname, lastname, dateofbirth, jobtitle, company, country) with the country data base on the country cosw. The country code is the used to generate the country fullname, currency(objects), languages(objects), and region.
